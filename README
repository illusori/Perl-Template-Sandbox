NAME
    Template::Sandbox - Fast pure-perl template engine sandboxed from your
    application.

VERSION
    version 1.04_02

DESCRIPTION
    Template::Sandbox is Yet Another Templating module, designed primarily
    for use in a webserver environment but usable anywhere, providing a more
    secure "sandboxed" environment than most templating systems.

    The core design philosophy for Template::Sandbox is that the template
    logic should have no access outside the template beyond that which you
    choose to permit it, this is frequently known as sandboxing.

    Unlike many other template systems, available on CPAN or in other
    languages, Template::Sandbox doesn't give the template access to the
    global variables of your application or to the core functions of the
    language.

    This means that your template authors only have access to the data and
    functionality that your application developers choose to grant them,
    this encourages both to work with "published" interfaces between the two
    systems - your template authors can't reach into the application's
    internal-only data, and so your application developers can change that
    internal data without worrying that the templates will stop working or
    expose confidential information.

    Template::Sandbox also provides exceptional performance, ranking among
    the fastest of the fully-featured template engines that don't rely on
    embedding perl within the templates.

    Template::Sandbox also provides the usual gamut of behaviours and
    optional features: caching compiled templates, includes, flow control,
    embedded expressions, cascading template candidates, and useful
    debugging information in case of errors.

    Furthermore, Template::Sandbox is designed to be subclassable should you
    wish to customize or extend other of its features.
