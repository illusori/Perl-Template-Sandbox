Revision history for Template::Sandbox

1.01_04 Version released at 2009-12-30-07:11.  *** Development version. ***
        Version started at  2009-12-29-11:14.
        COMPAT BUSTER: $current_dir no-longer defaults to Cwd::cwd() when
            find_template() is called, instead an undef value will be passed:
            if you need the cwd you can work it out yourself. :)
        Removed dependency on Cwd.
        Store special loop vars as array rather than hash.
        Only build special loop vars if any are needed by loop.
        Added tests for special loop var optimizations.
        Added tests for subscript access of special vars. (var['__prev__']).
        Added "case-study" style snippets to caching documentation.
        Added benchmark dump to performance section.

1.01_03 Version released at 2009-12-09-22:19.  *** Development version. ***
        Version started at  2009-12-09-20:14.
        Knew those unixy file paths in the tests' error-match regexps
        would bite me eventually:
            made the error text tests properly OS-agnostic.
        Remembered to update coverage stats this time.

1.01_02 Version released at 2009-12-08-12:38.  *** Development version. ***
        Version started at  2009-12-08-08:29.
        Release focus: optimizing the compile and optimization phases.
        Major optimization to jump target renumbering in template optimization.
        Only call _delete_instr() when actually needed.  Doh.
        Prebuild list of jump-targets for speed when merging adjacent literals.
        Correctly made FUNC_NEEDS_TEMPLATE a constant sub.
        Use tr/// instead of m// for newline-counting during compile.
        Replace nasty array munging during compile with splice().
        Moved a few regexp compiles outside the loops using them.

1.01_01 Version released at 2009-10-07-10:48.  *** Development version. ***
        Version started at  2009-09-10-13:25.
        No-longer assumes english-localized perl error text in tests.
        Unreadable template test: improved check that it really is unreadable.
